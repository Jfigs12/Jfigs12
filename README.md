Hi!
Im Jason! I am currently a Senior Pursuing a BS in Computer Science at Johnson and Wales University and am currently aiming to expand my knowledge with
software development, as well as expanding my knowledge of how to incorporate external factors and naturally appearing elements in our everyday environment to 
increase the efficiency of my software and gain inspiration from it!

I enjoy a numerous amount of things such as but
not limited to...
  - Software Development
  - Tinkering
  - Understanding new Concepts
  - Photography
  - Skateboarding
  - Exploring new realms and fields of study and nature!

I am primarily focusing on creating more understandable software as well as more efficient
software as well! I am more than open to new ideas, concepts, different and unique ways of 
doing things, and ways to improve on what I do!
